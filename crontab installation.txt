Step 1: Install the ‘cronie’ package.

#sudo yum install cronie -y

Step 2: Enable the ‘cronie’ service.

#sudo systemctl enable crond.service

Step 3: Start the ‘cronie’ service.

#sudo systemctl start crond.service

The status of the ‘cronie’ service should now reflect as ‘active’:

#sudo systemctl status crond | grep Active

 Active: active (running) since Tue 2023-04-11 16:47:06 UTC; 18s ago
Hence, you can consider installing ‘cronie’ manually on your instances as it is available in the Amazon Linux 2023 repository. Once installed, you can set up cron jobs as usual.

(Optional) To verify the status of ‘cronie’:

#sudo systemctl status crond.service
